# WeSplit

The first example application From Hacking With Swift's 100 Days of SwiftUI re-written using [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture "TCA")

The original source for this is [Paul Hudson's Hackiing With Swift](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/SwiftUI/project1 "https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/SwiftUI/project1")

The original was open source licenced, I'm carrying that over.

## Requirements

- Xcode 16+. Not so much for the code, but the tests are written using Swift Testing.

## Notes

Fairly simple app - not sure that using TCA provides any extra benefits over the usual MVVM used with SwiftUI, but hey-ho.

## TODO

- [ ] Prevent invalid input (non-numeric, negative numbers...)
